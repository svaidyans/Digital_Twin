## About Digital Twin
A Digital Twin is a virtual representation of a process, product or service.  This pairing of the virtual and physical worlds allows analysis of data and monitoring of systems to head off problems before they even occur, prevent downtime, develop new opportunities and even plan for the future by using simulations.  Digital twins consist of three components: a data model, a set of analytics or algorithms, and knowledge.

Let us look at some of the commercial and FOSS (free, open source) offerings.

### GE Predix
GE has a digital platform called Predix.  It's [Asset](https://www.predix.io/resources/tutorials/tutorial-details.html?tutorial_id=1736&tag=1715&journey=Exploring%20Asset%20service&resources=1710,1736,1711,1951,2456) service allows modelling an asset to it's digital twin counterpart.  Also check out this compelling [video](https://youtu.be/2dCz3oL2rTw).

### Bosch
Bosch's IoT Suite enables applications to manage digital twins of their IoT device assets in a simple, convenient, robust, and secure way. Applications can store and update the data, properties, and relationships of assets and all relevant changes are notified.  It is marketed as "Bosch IoT Things".  Check it out [here](https://www.bosch-iot-suite.com/things/).

### Siemens
Siemens claims its PLM Suite covers all the hardware, software and electronic domains a digital twin needs.  Their suite covers  product simulations, plant simulations, manufacturing process simulations and maintenance simulations.  Check it out [here](https://community.plm.automation.siemens.com/t5/Digital-Twin-Knowledge-Base/Why-Siemens-digital-twin-capabilities-are-the-best-in-the-market/ta-p/432989).

### Dassault
Dassault Syst√®mes has a complete digital platform branded as [3DExperience](https://www.3ds.com/about-3ds/3dexperience-platform/).  Interestingly they have built a virtual replica of Singapore with [3DExperienCity](https://ifwe.3ds.com/natural-resources/3dexperiencityr).

### Microsoft
Microsoft Azure IoT has the concept of a [device twin](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-device-twins) that is part of their device management solution. A device twin is automatically created when a device is connected to the MS IoT Hub. The device twin is a JSON file the stores the device state information that can be used synchronize device information with back-end processes.

### Amazon
Amazon refers to a [AWS IoT Device Shadow](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html) as their version of a digital twin. A device shadow is a JSON file that contains the state information, meta-data, timestamp, unique client token and version of a device connected to the device shadow service. There are 3 basic REST APIs that can be used to interact with the device shadow: GET, UPDATE, DELETE. You can also interact with device shadows using MQTT messages.

### IBM
IBM has been one of the pioneers in the Digital twin space.  As part of the [Watson IoT platform](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/GA_information_management/ga_im_device_twin.html#device_twins) they have a [Device Twin](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/GA_information_management/ga_im_device_twin.html#device-twins) and an [Asset Twin](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/GA_information_management/ga_im_device_twin.html#asset-twins-things-).

### Eclipse
The Eclipse Foundation is a not-for-profit organization with world-class professionals and Fortune 100 companies coming together for open source software collaboration and innovation. It is home to more than 350 open source projects, including runtimes, tools, and frameworks for a wide range of technology domains such as the Internet of Things, automotive, geospatial, systems engineering, etc.  [Eclipse Ditto](https://www.eclipse.org/ditto/) is the open-source project of Bosch (as part of the Bosch IoT Suite) that provides a ready-to-use functionality to manage the state of Digital Twins. It provides access to them and mediates between the physical world and their digital representation.

## Eclipse Ditto implementation
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Ditto.png" width="480" height="320"></img>
</p>

Ditto domain model for "Things" of IoT is very generic and a structure has two elements:
- Attributes: intended for managing static meta data of a Thing - as JSON object - which does not change frequently.
- Features: intended for managing state data (e.g. sensor data or configuration data) of a Thing.
